# go-rover

Files relevant to a rover-making project.
Re-usable Arduino-ESP8266 API.

Project contains:
* Arduino code for Motor Controllers
* A wrapper written for WiFi chip (ESP8266) communication
* Sensor-data transfer code written using this wrapper (can be used as examples)
* A 3D model that was 3D printed, used to extend my rover platform to fit the motors atop.
